        <h2>Advantages and Disadvantages of AI</h2>
        <h3>Advantages of AI</h3>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence offers numerous advantages across various fields. It automates 
            repetitive tasks, boosting efficiency and productivity while reducing human errors. 
            AI enhances accuracy in areas like healthcare and finance, leading to better 
            decision-making. Unlike humans, AI systems can operate 24/7 without fatigue, ensuring 
            continuous workflow. It also drives innovation by accelerating research and technological 
            advancements. Additionally, AI strengthens cybersecurity with advanced threat detection, 
            helping prevent cyber attacks. With its ability to process vast amounts of data quickly, 
            AI improves problem-solving and decision-making, making it a valuable tool in modern 
            society.</p>
        <p><strong>Key Advantages of Artificial Intelligence</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> AI automates repetitive tasks, improving productivity.</li>
            <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> AI minimizes human errors in various fields like healthcare and finance.</li>
            <li><strong>24/7 Availability:</strong> AI systems operate continuously without fatigue.</li>

        </ul>
        
        <h3>Disadvantages of AI</h3>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence, despite its advantages, has several drawbacks. 
            One major concern is the high cost of development and maintenance, making 
            it inaccessible to smaller businesses. Additionally, 
            AI-driven automation leads to job displacement, affecting employment opportunities. 
            Ethical issues, including bias in decision-making, pose challenges as AI systems rely on 
            data that may not always be fair or accurate. AI also lacks creativity and emotional intelligence,
             limiting its ability to think beyond programmed logic. Furthermore, excessive dependence on AI 
             increases cybersecurity risks, as hackers can exploit AI-powered systems for malicious activities.
              Lastly, AI-driven misinformation and deepfake technology threaten trust in digital information,
             making regulation and monitoring essential.</p>
             <p><strong>Challenges and Risks of Artificial Intelligence</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Job Displacement:</strong> AI automation may replace certain jobs.</li>
            <li><strong>High Costs:</strong> AI development and implementation require significant investment.</li>
            <li><strong>Bias and Ethics:</strong> AI models may reflect biases present in training data.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Risks:</strong> AI systems can be vulnerable to hacking and misuse.</li>
